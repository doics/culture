India US affirmative action w.r.t consti
What is affirmative action
-means positive intervention of state to uplift the hitherto backward and vulnerable sections of society
-US has racial discrimination and India has cast based so both taken measure as per consti to correct the wrongs.


INDIA
1. article 15 and 16 explicitly mentions about the positive discrimination in favour of SC ST and SEBC, in matters of employment and education.
2. DPSPs state the ideal of welfarism. they direct state towards 
a) giving free legal aid to poor.
b) reduce inequality 
c) treating women with respect and free education to children upto 14 years.
3. schedule 5 and 6 specifically reserve additional benefits for the regions in matters of law, administration and courts.

USA 
-focus on issues education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities and women who have been historically excluded groups in America
-Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment
1. US constitution provides for equal protection of laws and the affirmative action can be challenged for its compatibility with it. Whereas the Indian constitution specifically provides in its fundamental rights and DPSP for preferences in employment and education for reserved castes.
2. As it is not specifically provided in the US constitution it can be modified or struck down however the same is not possible in India.
3. It has resulted in caste based politics in India and deepened the issue to a larger scale resulting in anti-reservation and new reservation protests. Similar situation in US where anti-racial feelings have evolved leading to aggression, public shooting and murder.
4. In US, affirmative action is available for admission in universities, while in India it is for admission, employment, promotions as well as electoral seats.
\

both india and US suffer from inefficacy of policy implementation. still the vulnerable communities remain vulnerable. there is politics being played in the name of vulnerability. however both the nations are capable enough to evolve a better understanding and policy idiosyncratic to themselves for betterment of all.


->Governor removing
SC directions in 2010 (B.P.Singhal Vs. Union of India,)
-The removal of governor by the President cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner,
it should have some strong cause.
-A change in central govt cannot be a cause of removal of governors
-A decision to remove governors can be challenged in the court of law,
 removing the president as the sole authority to decide on removal of governors
 
 From various committees
 -Sarkaria Commission: Governors should not be removed before completion of five year term,
 governor should be given a chance to to explain their conducts
 -NCRWC[National comm to review working of consti] opined that the President should appoint the 
 Governor of State, 
 after consultation of CM. Normally five years tenure should be adhered to
 -Puncchi Commission: the term “Pleasure of president” to be removed and 
 the state legislature should be the removal authority
 
 ->India UK election comparision
-UK and India are parliamentary democracies. We largely follow the Westminster model prevalent in UK. Indian lok sabha is similar to the House of Commons in UK.
The similarities are :
1) Both follow the first past the post model.
2) Both are multiparty democracies with liberal provisions for forming political parties.
3) The election commission, an independent body oversees the elections in both countries.
The differences are :
1) Due to India's large size, the number of voters per constituency is significantly high in India.
2) the date of election is fixed in UK, whereas it is decided by the EC in India.
3) UK still uses ballot boxes, whereas India has moved on to EVMs.
4) The use of money, muscle power in elections is low in UK. Instances of rigging, violence, booth capture are minimum there.
There is increasing clamour for first past the post to be replaced by proportional system. 
It has the following advantage :
1) It reduces vote wastage as in BSP with third largest vote share got no seat in the recent elections.
2) It gives better representation to the people's mandate.
3) it provides space for minority groups.
However, there are certain disadvantages :
1) It leads to fragmented mandate.
2) Unstable government.
3) proliferation of interest groups inimical to national unity and integrity.
A better alternative as suggested by the NCRWC is to adopt the "50% + 1" model, wherein a wining candidate must get more than half the votes to be elected.

->Japan consti framing -NOTED
- provides for a parliamentary system of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights
- replaced Japan's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system 
-The Japanese Constitution was drawn up under the allied occupation at the end of WWII 
and is often referred to as the "Peace Constitution" due to its pacifist nature. 
The US Government drafted the Constitution in under a week's time and
 presented the same to the Japanese for translation and adoption. The Constitution,
 thus adopted, did not undergo any kind of scrutiny or debate by the Japanese people.
 It did not reflect the will of the people of Japan. In fact,
 they did not have an option other than to accept the will imposed upon them by 
 the Americans as their own.
 
 ->Local government before 73rd amendment
-was a state subject , each state was having their own structure

-No reservation for sc/st/woments
-no independent financial resources
-Inadequate planning viz no welfare schemes of their own
-no organized structure/hierarchy
-Absence of Devolution of powers

timely free and fair election for local bodies
-State finance commision to recommend on grants for panchayat and measures
to increase their finances
-Reservation for sc/st/womens
-Allow panchayat to levy taxes ,tolls etc.
-global 3 tier structure at distric , block and rural level
Problems
-finance commission recommendation are non binding.
-29 items assigned to panchayat comes under different ministries and not under
Panchayat raj and rural development.

4. Millions of women were brought out of their homes into the political arena because of INM.
5. Secularism was a very basic tenet on which INM worked which later became the pillar of the Indian polity, society and culture.

->Globalization and democracy
Globalisation is the movement of goods, people and ideas across the world. It has affected every section of the society and every sphere of the country that is economic, political and social. Its relationship on democracy is mixed.
Globalisation promoting democracy
1) Spread of ideas of the western democracies such as liberty, fraternity, equality, individuality etc. to the developing countries has made its people demand for democracy on western lines.
2) Globalisation has led to economic growth. Hence, People prefer democracies because they allow free movement unlike authoritarian countries such as North Korea.
3) International media and organisation which are dominated by western nations pressurise government from being authoritarian.
4) Migration of people has raised demands for accommodating the minorities something which can be done in democracies.
Globalisation denouncing democracy
1) In search for global markets, western developed nations establish puppet authoritarian governments in developing nations.
2) As globalisation makes movement of ideas easier, governments have become more authoritarian to restrict such flow.
3) Multinational corporations influence decision making in developing countries especially the African countries undermining peoples will.
4) Globalisation has promoted only a particular concept of democracy I.e the western model, it disregards the variations in developing countries which value different ideals.

->The RIght to Free and Compulaory Education Act( RTE ) Act,2009 
-was enacted by center to increase the quality as well as accessibility of elementary education of children aged between 6 and 14 years in India ,making free education as their fundamental right under article 21st of the Indian constitution.

Successes of the Act:-
1.A significant increase in the enrollments rates accompanied by reduction in drop-out rates in primary schools.
2.forcing the unaided and private run schools to admit 25% of the total students form the disadvantage groups of the society.
3.making primary education a fundamental right of children and hence undeniable by states and all those agencies involved in education of society .

But,the act fall short of meeting it's objectives even after four years since it's implementation.The elementary education in the country continue to be far below the accepted standard and plagued with the old hurdles and issues some of which are described in short below:

1. High shortages of teaching staffs in primary schools .Teaching standards and sincerity of school teachers remain far below the required level.
2.Irregular conduct of exams for hiring of teachers which are often marred with allegation of rampant bribery and forgery .The sanctioned strength of teachers hired remained far below the available vacancy
3.The Teacher Training programme fall short of imparting good training skills in teachers and injecting proper teaching methodology. 
4.Central and States expenses on education is much below the level required.Schools face critical infrastructure crunches in terms of friendly classroom and basic school facilities.

->SAfrica Bill of rights (BOR) wr.t indian FR -NOTED
Similarities
(1) Both  form the bedrock of the constitution and democracy
(2) available against the State. In fact some limited rights  against private citizens also.
(3) Under both , while most rights are available to citizens alone, some universally recognised
 rights such as the right to life and equality are available to all persons. 
(4) Neither the FRs nor BoRs are absolute. Both are subject to reasonable restrictions and limitations.

Differences:
(1) SA Constitution was framed in 1996, learn lot more from experiences of other vibrant democracies 
like India. BoRs is the most elaborate and extensive set of rights endowed upon citizens anywhere in the world 
rights such as the right to privacy and the right to healthy environment explicitly mentioned in the BoRs.
(2) Right to vote which finds a place in the BoRs not FR
(3) Right to property, not FR now..
(4) Right to information, which is included in BoRs, is only a statutory right in India.
(5) The SA Constitution provides for creation of a special constitutional court for the enforcement of BoRs.
 This court has jurisdiction only over constitutional matters and controversies.so its less burdened and 
 give detailed focus on enforcement.



->1st and 4th Amendment of US consitution
-Two of 10 amendments which marks US rights Bill
-US consitution was created among revolution and giving right was more important than Unity/Security
-Indian consti was prepared among turmoil and religious disharmony so rights given to people not on par with US right
->1st amendment (US)

->The US system

While the President has executive powers to enter into a treaty, it will only be applicable tot he United States when the Senate (The upper House) agrees to it by two-thirds majority. The House of Representatives (Lower House) has no role in ratifying a treaty. The lower house only has a role if the treaty needs funds to be operationalised which can only be sanctioned by the House of representatives.
Another way to sanction a treaty is to pass it as a common bill. Thus, both the houses vote on it as any other ordinary bill.

If the subject of any treaty lies within the domain of the president's executive power, he can enter into the agreement. However, it is not binding on the US and can be revoked by any future president.
