->Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) - NASA

- part of NASA's near earth object observation programme. Real samples asteroids and other extraterrestrial objects are excellent source of informations regarding formation of earth and universe, and feasibility studies for human exploration and habitability in space in general and Mars in particular.

ARM seeks to build a space shot gun which will chop off a piece of a near-earth asteroid, following that a robotic spacecraft will carry the piece of asteroid to more stable moon's orbit. 
-Apart from that it will also help scientist to get hands on knowledge about the surface of asteroids and make a decision whatever it should be studied or not.
-Later a manned mission will extract the asteroid piece from moon orbit and take it to the earth for the said scientific purpose. NASA plans to launch ARM by 2020.

Advantage
The ARM and proposed method of extracting celestial samples is revolutionary method in space science. Till now, the main piece of information has been the electromagnetic wave, such as - visible rays, x-rays, infrared rays, microwaves, etc.
- These EM waves provides the main fodder of all the knowledge of space we have accumulated so far. 
-Very seldom we have got hold on real samples of meteorites, asteroids, star dust and comets etc. 
-The said method is expected to widen the knowledge base of space science, a step forward in human civilisation.
-Will help to develop platform for breaking large asteroids collision of whom with earth can damage the later.

it should be made sure by careful study that this space adventure don't led to any destruction on earth.

->CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Crispr associated protein 9) :-

 Generally it is editing of DNA sequence to remove the unwanted DNA portion and adding suitable protein in DNA for creating a stable and healthy DNA.
CRISPR is repetitive base sequence of DNA. As a result of previous exposures to a virus, Each repetition is followed by spacer DNA which are non coding DNA from genes .When such a sequence is seen, it is attacked and cut off. The Cas-9 protein is used as a cutting tool to excise the sequence.
CRISPR can be "trained" to memorise new DNA sequences, which will then be treated as dangerous.

Benefits:-
# edit out many other single gene disorders, such
as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia ,Beta-thalassemia
# editing out genetic disorders.
#create immunity to various diseases and
conditions.
# create designer children. Parents an could end
up "shopping" for desirable traits, be it intelligence, appearance,
sporting ability etc

->Earthquakes
->why cant scientist predict it
-We have developed superior technology to record seismic waves and find the epicentre but we are still not able to predict their arrival precisely like floods and storms.
-Geomorphology, at present, can only gleam certain information from below the lithosphere as it is not possible to drill very deep
-Most of our understanding related to earths interior is from "second hand sources" like earthquake waves and vulcanicity. Direct sources are limited to deep drilling which can only provide information to a certain depth.
-hard to measure the stress level of rocks and predict failure with accuracy as its not technologically feasible with the current science
-the study of velocities of P and S waves predicted the earthquake in New York State in 1973 but the same method failed in other parts of the world
-Even if the P waves are observed, there is very less time left for the destructive S waves to reach the surface, leaving no time for prediction.

->AM/FM/Digital Raido
AM amplitutude modulation [Demodulation carried at receiver end. so quality 
loss there .]
-is the encoding of information in a carrier wave by varying the amplitude 
of the wave
-Frequency remains same.
This is long distance transmission,Quality is poor coz of noise mixure and 
changing modulation
so receiver not alway receive the same signal strength
FM [Demodulation carried at receiver end. so quality loss there .]
-  is the encoding of information in a carrier wave by varying the instantaneous
 frequency of the wave.
-Amplitude remain same. 
- shif the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies.
- improved Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
Because of uniform amplitude the radio voice quality is better in FM.
-Used for shorter distance
Medium waves:
1-> Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band 
used mainly for AM radio broadcasting.
Digital Radio
-new technology used in radio transmission.
-Convert analogue signal into digital.
-encoded signals in form of digital packets(numbers) which are transmitted
from the transmitter, and these encoded messages are reconverted by the receiver 
to get message
-No matter what comes between your radio and the transmitter, the signal almost 
always gets through
-Best for radio communication.
-IN AM/FM signal becomes part of the wave that carries it.so damage to wave is 
damage to signal.

->Internet of Things(IoT)
Internet of Things(IoT) is a concept where intelligent systems comprising softwares, Telecom and electronics hardware are connected by Internet and act as a connected interfaces talking to each other reducing human intervention and effort.
involved three distinct stages:
(A) Sensors which collect data,
(B) Application which collects and analyses this data for further consolidation and,
(C) Transmission of data to the decision-making server.
usage in india
-smart cities , smart waster managemetn , smart water management (checking quality , leakages),smart agri (soil moistures, pest , nutrients)
environment , govt services ,health etc.


->Internet US dominance
-With all major social networking and communication sites having their servers in the USA and Canada (except China), these companies have vast amounts of big data that reveal our preferences, choices as well as private details. They are arm twisted by the US govt to share such data without our permission.
-The internet architecture is also dominated by the USA. All major tech logistic companies – Apple, Facebook, twitter, whatsapp, Microsoft etc. are headquartered in the USA and as such must comply with the govt directions there
-As far as the governance mechanism is concerned, it is operated by ICANN (Internet Cooperation on Assigned Names and Numbers). For all its arguments of its global character, the fact remains that it is a body dominated by the USA and staffed primarily by US citizens
ICANN
-Non profit org.
-Manage Internet protocol numbers and Domain Name System root
-policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level domains (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers.
-Maintain registery of internet protocol identifiers.

-India can partner with Bricks to overcome this
-We can take cue from China as it has blocked US headquartered sites like twitter and has their own version of it.


->LEAD
Lead is a heavy metal with a high toxicity. It can be easily moulded and shaped and can easily form alloys with other metals. Hence, it is widely used in industries. This wide use of lead has increased incidences of lead-poisoning.

The causes behind lead poisoning are :
0.though eatable which are not properly tested and regulated. Recent example of Maggie
1. Wide spread use of lead acid batteries is a major cause poisoning especially for the workers and people living around the industries.
2. Lead paints, especially locally manufactured paints have as high concentration as 10,000 ppm (Compared to BIS recommendation of 90ppm)
3. Lead is also entering the food chain through vegetables.
4. The maximum damage is caused due to inhalation of lead particles, especially of sizes less than 10PM.

Consequences
1. Small exposure to lead causes symptoms like headaches, nausea, irritability, tiredness and stomach ache. Hence, it has a tendency to go undiagnosed.
2. Large exposure affects development of brain, especially in children and lowers IQ.
3. Lead exposure also makes the body susceptible to anaemia as it prevents formation of haemoglobin.
4. It also increases risk of early death.

->Origin of life thories
-Abiogenesis -> life originated from inorganic matters like Amino acid (recent NASA experiment support this)
-Materialistic theory: slow and gradual process of chemical evaluation where DNA and RNA evolved
-Clay Theory:formed from complex molecules of clay
-Sponteneous generation: certain complex living organism generated by spontenous decaying of living and non living matters
-Electric spark theory: lightening might have started building block
-

-Recent NASA experiment suggest origin of life can be abiological
-our DNA and RNA consisit of 5 key bases and out of these 3 (called nucleobases)could be formed after a chemical called Pyrimidine(also found in space meteorites) is freezed in vacume under extreme low temprature(similar conditioins as in space) and is exposed to UV rays.
 
 
 
 ->Mammoth
-Close relative of Asian Elephant.
-Used to live in colder region surronding poles
-Got extinct may be due to hunting or climate change.
-Removal of frost due to global farming has lead to discover of well preserved 'wooly mammoth" carcasses
-Scientist trying to recreate living mammoth using below techniques
1)CRISPR -Researchers analysed DNA from mammoths preserved
-Used that to reproduce exact copies of 14 mammoth genes
-These were integrated into the elephant genome, where they functioned as normal DNA
-CRISPR is useful to do the precise edit in the DNA.replacing sections of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes
used to replace the DNA of living elephant with the differential gene of extinct mammoth
2)Cloning : 
-By reconstruct the whole mammoth genome.
-From preserved CAcasses ,find a cell containing nucleus with a complete viable genome in it
-put that nucleus into an elephant embryo
-Plant that embryo into female elephant.




->Net neutrality implies that all websites and services should be treated 
equal and there should be no discrimination in terms of speed and cost of access
 This means that a telco can't block a certain website (because of commercial 
 or other interests) or promote one service over the other
 It also means that an internet provider or telco cannot throttle speeds for one 
 service or charge extra
 If you don't want your mobile operator to charge extra for WhatsApp, Skype or 
 YouTube and promote its own services over the others
 
 Airtel recently offer airtel zero a platform where it will promote some deveopers 
 apps and access to those will not cut andy data usage for the user.
 - it will offer users free access to certain mobile apps
 -app developers and internet content service providers (or over-the-top content providers) 
 will be able to make some part of or their entire mobile app free for customers.
 -users will not have to pay data charges (or get usage allowance deducted from data packs)
 when they access these apps via Airtel's mobile data network. 
 -Internet.org by facebook is also one such platform.On reliance network it offer 
 free access  to facebook and some other apps.

b) Data Transmission: to send data seamlessly without any transmission loss.
c) Medical field: detection of particle traversing human body and detection of abnormalities (cancer detection)
d) Nuclear-terrorism: can prevent pilferage of nuclear fuels by early detection.
e) Great significance for us in all above fields.

->installation of INO at Bodi West hills region of Theni district attracted controversies, mainly being
a) Ecological concerns: Risks to buffer zone of Mudumalai,forest,animals,
-risk to Mullaperiyar dam due to rock blasts 
- But IISc have clearly mentioned this will not affect nearby forests and EIA study on dam also ssay so effect. Also, neutrino has no mutagenic properties.
b) Accusations of secrecy and lack of transparency (was earlier considered a part of US Fermi lab’s project). But it has been cleared that it’s totally indigenous.
GOI have cleared this initiative, and in years to come India will be utilizing and capitalizing on its immense potential.


->over-the-top (OTT) applications
-refers to application or services which deliver , text , images ,videos,calls or any other media
to receipants over the internet.
-ISP may have information about the data package being transferred but is not responsible for, 
nor able to control, the viewing abilities, copyrights, and/or other redistribution of the content
In India OTT examples are Skype, WhatsApp, Viber etc .
IT involve both Economic and security concerns.

-funds were sought from the Ministry of Social Welfare to provide a pair of pure-bred puppies each to S.C./S.T having experience in rearing these dongs
-prevailing price for one Mudhol pup ranging between Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 8,000, the initial beneficiaries have gained on selling

->significance
-first is to revive the pure-bred Mudhol hound, while the second is to encourage alternative animal husbandry practices with a built-in social welfare agenda


->Smart maps use mapping technology that capture a broad range of data and are built to update quickly and correctly in order to give people the most accurate information possible.
They are designed to be easy and intuitive to use in order to reach the widest possible audience, and they encourage innovation by making it easy for users or businesses to incorporate their own data.
Uses and benefits of smart maps:
1.	Less time in commuting: 1 in 4 urban workers spends over 90 minutes commuting each day
2.	Reduce time taken for ambulances – like enhancing the green channel;ambulances lose precious minutes - up to 25% of response time - locating addresses
3.	accessibility to government offices
4.	enhancing last mile delivery for logistics- Logistics companies spend 53% of costs on last-mile delivery
5.	better physical safety for women - 73% of women fear for their physical safety when traveling at night
6.	disaster management : better responsiveness by locating and mobilising resources
7.	enhancing urban connectivity : citizens will be better able to locate nearest transport points,hospitals etc
some of the concerns that may arise would be through : 
•	security – may be misused by anti state actors
•	difficult to use for people without access to requisite technology

-also essential for better coordination and cooperation between ISRO and different sectors of economy
-will make space program more accountable and hence more acceptable to public.will help  for aligning space priorities with developmental needs
-but should not thwart creativity and innovation.


->Tools for brain computer interaction [TOBI]
-is a project initiated by European union which will make the life of disabled people easy specially with disabled Motor.
-this tobi project have electrodes that will be given to patient to hold that will then monitor the brain activity without actually interfering with brain electrical signal
-and will then interact with computer that will send signal of activity to motor control in initiate voluntary movement like in case of a paralysed limb thus controlling and restoring motor or muscle activities of such person .

Application
-1)communications and control -to increase people's communication potential and opportunities by providing access to a variety of devices such as virtual keyboards, internet, email, telephony,
2)Motor Substitution - to restore lost motor function
-3)Entertainment
development of  "functional" applications like-giving the patient control of ambient features such as wall display, lighting and music, which not only allows them to control their environment, but alos express their feelings to others in a non-verbal manner.photo browsing , music navigation and interface for social networking sites,BCI single or multi users games.
4)Motor Recovery
BCI is intented as a rehabilitation technology (for people who have partially, or totally lost some functions-which occurs after a cerebrovascular accident) since it seeks to substitute some of the lost functions.

After completion of the project the TOBI will help to improve the quality of life of disabled people and the effectiveness of rehabilitation.
